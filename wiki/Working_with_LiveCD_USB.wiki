=Working with Live Distros=

Live CDs and bootable USB drives are convinient to use. Wouldn't it be nice if you could put
wepbuster on your favorite live distro and carry it wherever you go? It's not really that difficult.
Here are some hints I have collected when I modified SliTaz/Aircrack-ng liveCD to include
wepbuster: (SliTaz/Aircrack-ng can be downloaded from http://www.aircrack-ng.org)

  1. Make sure standard perl libraries are installed. SliTaz doesn't have those so I had to copy them from another perl installation. Those libraries/modules should go anywhere within the output of running perl -e 'print @INC'

  2 The perl included in SliTaz does not support threading. I had to recompile perl and enable threading. See INSTALL inside perl source tarball for details on how to enable it.

  3.
