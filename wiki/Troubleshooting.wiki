There are few simple hints that you may consider if the program does not work for you.


  * First of all, download the latest archive (beta-0.2) that you can find in the Downloads page. If you are one of those 3 unfortunate souls that have initially downloaded the archive, chances are, you've got the wrong archive. Changes have been made shortly after that.

  * Make sure the card's driver is properly loaded

  * You do not need to put the card in monitor mode. The program does this for you.

  * Upon starting the program, it should show the inject interface and monitor interface plus the mac address
   Ex. MODE: crack         (using: wlan0/mon0 === 00:c0:ca:1a:0e:41)

  * If for some out of this world reason, the card showing instead of the above are both the same, (wlan0/wlan0) and when you looked at "airmon-ng start wlan0" it says that "(monitor mode enabled on mon0)", you can just specify your $inject_iface and $monitor_iface inside the script.

  * Having a different monitor interface is due to the possibility that the in-built kernel driver was used, aka mac80211. 
  Some wireless card drivers don't need to create a Radio tap interface, so the same interface is used for injecting and    monitoring 

  * Make sure to capture your terminal session so that I can review the output of the program. My regular expression skillz could slip from time to time..

  * Finally, don't use a live CD yet. Use a linux installation (it can be inside vmware but is better otherwise so you won't think the program runs slow) and modify the aircrack-ng sources mentioned in the home page.
